## Inspiration
Solidarity: An app to help you light the path to a better future and make a difference in whatever way you can.
Wanting to make our world a better place is what we all hope to do and helping each other is the key to making a difference. Our app helps you take the first step.
The idea for Solidarity was born because of the current status of the world. Whether it’s the COVID-19 pandemic, the constant threat of global warming and climate change, or the current situation in Ukraine, we wanted to make an impact.

As students, we may not be able to make an impact on a large enough scale but we hoped to make the road easier for others. And that is what Solidarity aims to do.

## What it does
As you open the app, you will see the option to donate to any number of the current crisis around the world. Simply press the donate button and you will be directed to a list of charities and organizations that are at the forefront of making a difference. Now press the heart icon and you will immediately be redirected to the organizations page where you can find all the relevant information before you make a donation.

Once that’s done, you will receive an SMS at your registered mobile number thank you for your donation which has been implemented with the Twilio API.

## How we built it
To begin, we created a Figma prototype of how the UI would look and then began coding the app in React Native using Expo. 
(The app is contained in app/mainapp)

## Challenges we ran into
Building the app was a challenge for us. We have never tried anything on this scale before! However bringing to life an idea we had in our heads and turning into something concrete and tangible was extremely rewarding. 
Looking at the situation in the world, we really wanted to try and make an impact in some way. Furthermore, no one on the team had prior experience building an app in React Native, managing states, navigations and API's.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that the app is fully functional and could be deployed even today! Moreover, we are grateful to be associated with an idea that in a time of crisis could potentially change someone's life for the better. 

## What we learned
We learned coding in React Native, making mockups in Figma, working with the Twilio API, navigating between screens in an app, UI/UX design, time management and most importantly that any idea can be built with a few late nights and a whole lot of coffee!

## What's next for Solidarity
In the near future we hope to expand the app to provide services for people in crisis including shelter support, government directives in case of emergency and information on what you can do if you find yourself in need of this help.
We truly feel that our app can make a difference and we hope that you stand in solidarity with us to build a brighter future!
